kidnapping,"February 23, 2024",Benue,"Boderi Isyaku, a notorious bandit, insurgent and ruthless killer, has been killed by security operatives in a gun duel alongside some of his fighters.Nigeriacrime.com learned that it was Boderi who plotted and executed the 11th March 2021 abduction of 39 students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, Igabi LGA. This high-profile kidnapping generated shock waves and massive panic around the country, as dozens of young students were whisked away and their families left to deal with unimaginable turmoil.Samuel Aruwan overseeing Commissioner, Kaduna State Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs disclosed.Aruwan explained that the killer was neutralized by troops of the Nigerian Army, around Bada/Riyawa general areas of Chikun and Igabi Local Government Areas of Kaduna State.According to him, “stemming from consistent support to security forces by Kaduna State Governor, Senator Uba Sani, a major breakthrough has been recorded in Nigeria’s fight against banditry and terrorism. The notorious bandit, insurgent and ruthless killer, Boderi Isyaku, has been neutralized in a gun duel alongside some of his fighters, by troops of the Nigerian Army, around Bada/Riyawa general areas of Chikun and Igabi LGAs.”“This feat was confirmed to the Kaduna State Government by security forces carrying out internal security operations and diligent checks from human intelligence sources.”“Boderi, as he was simply known, had for nearly a decade propagated a reign of fear, death and destruction in Kaduna State and neighbouring Niger State, with a trademark of brutal attacks, mass abductions and cruel, relentless killing. His elimination comes as the culmination of tireless efforts by dedicated troops committed to restoring peace and security in the region. The General Officer Commanding, 1 Division, Nigerian Army (and Force Commander, Operation Whirl Punch) Major General VU Okoro, coordinated the operation through meticulous planning and intelligence.”“The troops on Wednesday night, came in contact with Boderi and his fighters around Bada general area of Chikun LGA. Despite the terrorists’ well-fortified position, the troops laid a successful ambush. Boderi and his associates walked into the trap, and were cornered.”In the ensuing confrontation, Boderi chose to resist the troops and engaged them in a fierce firefight. He was ultimately subdued, and his reign of terror ended in a burst of bullets and eternal ignominy. Two of his associates were likewise neutralized. After the operation, the troops recovered two AK47 rifles, 300 rounds of ammunition, nine AK47 magazines, one magazine carrier, one Baofeng radio set and five motorcycles.The elimination of Boderi Isyaku, as a notable milestone in the ongoing fight against terrorism and banditry, demonstrates the effectiveness of determined and coordinated efforts by security forces in confronting those who seek to spread fear and chaos.Boderi, known for his ruthlessness and cunning, had long eluded the grasp of security forces while orchestrating the kidnappings of prominent figures, innocent civilians, school children and students with impunity. His activities not only caused untold pain to thousands of victims and families but also posed a stiff challenge to law enforcement agents, who, at various times were only a whisker away from apprehending this menace.Boderi was involved in a range of deadly attacks spanning Sabon Birni, Rigasa, Buruku, Gwagwada, Rijana and Kateri general areas, the Kaduna-Abuja Road, the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road, as well as Shiroro, Alawa, and Mangoro general areas of neighbouring Niger State. His activities included vast and elaborate operations in cattle rustling and gunrunning. He was also known to have built a close rapport with terrorist groups, collaborating with them towards establishing footholds in these areas. Recent intelligence reports revealed his plans to attack a school in his sphere of operation. Those plans have been thankfully truncated.On the 24th of August 2021, Boderi masterminded another deadly attack, this time on the Afaka campus of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Igabi LGA. Two officers were killed and another was abducted. Weeks later, on 14th September 2021, Boderi led his gang of bandits in the kidnapping of the Emir of Bungudu, Alhaji Hassan Atto, around Dutse village, Chikun LGA. The Emir’s Police Detail was killed.These are a few highlights in the profile of a mindless monster, fueled by undiluted hate and evil, veiled underneath a harmless, innocent and youthful exterior. Without a doubt, this baby-faced terror was one of the most dangerous individuals in the country, single-handedly tearing apart the lives of entire communities across several states.Receiving the report, Governor Sani expressed his elation at the development, which he described as a pointer to the bravery and professionalism of the troops involved. The Governor commended Major General Okoro, for his stellar leadership, and praised the troops for their assertive victory. Governor Sani went on to assure security forces in Kaduna State of his unflinching support and readiness to sustain cooperation, towards the achievement of their objectives.In the wake of this development, authorities and members of the public must be informed that some of Boderi’s associates and gang members sustained gunshot injuries during that decisive encounter. Citizens in the general area and beyond are therefore enjoined not to render assistance (medical or otherwise) to individuals carrying such suspicious injuries, but to immediately report these persons to security agencies. The Kaduna State Security Operations Room is available 24 hours a day to receive reports of this nature, on the phone lines 09034000060 and 08170189999."

kidnapping,"January 18, 2024",Abuja,"The Federal Government on Wednesday, cautioned Nigerians against publicly crowd-funding through social media to raise funds for kidnap victims, saying that it is not only illegal, but counter productive.Minister of Defence, Abubakar Badaru, gave he warning on while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the end of the first Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting for 2024 presided over by President Bola Tinubu at the Council Chamber, Presidential Villa, Abuja.The Minister warning is coming on the heels of the latest tragic kidnap incidents in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja, where kidnappers of seven residents increased their ransom demand of N60 million to N100 million per victim, after worried citizens started online crowd-funding to meet the initial demand.Recall that 10 persons were abducted in the unfortunate incident but three of them were killed after the ransom was not paid quickly by the families of the victims who were kidnapped from an estate in Sagwari Layout, Dutse, Abuja, on January 7, 2024.The case took a different t dimension when former Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami, said he supported the crowd-funding efforts after an unnamed friend of his contributed N50 million towards meeting the ransom target.This heightened concern in Nigeria’s social media space, with many harping on the optics of crowdfunding the money and the precedent it could set for future cases.But Badaru described the development as unfortunate and demanded that it should be stopped as it emboldens the kidnappers and worsens the security situation.He explained that the recent upsurge of abductions in the suburbs of Abuja is because of the onslaught on kidnappers and bandits in the neighboring North-central and Northwestern States.He assured residents and all Nigerians that the security agencies are determined and working towards  blocking off the criminals and ending their menace.According to the Minister, “In FCT, these kidnappings happen around the suburbs, around now and locations that are bordering Kaduna and Niger States. And this is as a result of the current operations going on in the northwest and some parts of northcentral.“The bandits are fleeing and they are getting shelters around these areas and the security agencies are working very hard to push them out, block their movements and finish this thing once and for all.“The president has given us the marching order and all the support that we need and what the security agencies need to end this thing.“On crowd-funding, we all know there’s an existing law against payment of ransom. So, it is very sad for people to go over the internet, radio asking for donations to pay ransom. This will only worsen the situation, it will not help the situation at all as you have seen.“Initially, they asked for N60 million and now because of this funding and I learnt somebody has raised N50 million already through friends and media, they jacked up the ransom.“We believe we have to stop it, as painful as it is. We have to stop responding to payment of ransom. If we stop, over time, the kidnapping will not be profitable and they will stop.“It is not easy though but that is the law that you are know. So we want to call on the people to manage the kidnapping situation intelligently and very quietly, because talking too much about it, most especially raising funds through the public media is not  productive at all and should be discontinued.”"

He had been robbed of his phone earlier, so we could not reach him directly. He was supposed to return on the 10th. But he called my mom with someone’s phone who is also a worker in the church to inform her that he wouldn’t come home until the next day. That was the last time we heard from him.“The case was reported to the police station in Igando, but we didn’t see anything concrete until a few days later when one of us called them. The officer claimed the pastor said the police shouldn’t come for an investigation until a particular day when his members would be around. When the family went to the church, the pastor started screaming that we were disturbing his service.”Also speaking, Barnabas’s brother, Israel said, “The pastor told us not to involve the police because my brother is a cultist, so I asked whether he had seen him smoke or pierce any part of his body.“Another time, he said Barnabas had been sleeping with about four girls in the church. And I kept wondering how that got to do with his missing.“It’s been over two months now, and we have not seen Barnabas. We want the government to help us compel the pastor to tell us where Barnabas is because it was in his care that we last heard from him.”In his response, Samuel accused the family of trying to soil his name and the church’s reputation, adding that the missing drummer had come to the church on the evening of October 10 for a Bible study.“Normally, when they finish their drumming around 9 pm everyone goes to their house, which is what he did. I don’t know anything about it. I drove out of the church and went to my house.“I was told that they saw him on the 11th and that he went to cut his hair from there. They said he collected N3,000 from one of our members and left.“They said the mother had gone to the area command to make a report. They were no longer accusing any member of the church, but they are now accusing me directly, saying that I had something to do about it. What will I do with him?

And they were eventually rescued close to the RCC office along the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway.“They had gone to Ajalli to perform the sacrifice. It is what our people do. But, what they never envisaged was that the criminals were lurking around in the forest. So, they kidnapped them and matched them into the forest from where the other person escaped. We thank God for their safety. We thank our security men. They are doing well. Without them, police cannot operate successfully in this state.”In a viral video shared by vigilante operatives in the area, an escaped victim, who identified himself as Chiemelie, said they were leaving the river after performing their sacrifice when they were accosted and their motorbike was taken away from them by the gunmen.He started, “They are Fulani people.

kidnapping,"December 21, 2023",Kaduna,"A traditional ruler from Adamawa State, the Sarkin Tilijo Michika, under Mubi Emirate, Sarkin Suleiman Ibrahim Ahijo has revealed that his saving grace was that he disguised himself while travelling from North East to the Federal Capital, Abuja.The traditional ruler who said he had the blessing of HRH, Sir Isa Ahmadu, the Emir of Mubi Emirate Council and his District head, HRH Zira Audu Marye to speak, disclosed at a Security Dialogue Stakeholder Session on Community-based Solutions to Addressing Kidnapping on WednesdayThe dialogue is organized by the Nigerian Government, through the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC), and Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), working in collaboration with the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) via Decy-4 Technologies Limited, to create and implement a communications strategy on Anti-kidnapping in the country.Sarkin Sulaiman said, “I want to thank Almighty Allah for saving me from kidnappers after spending two days with them when I was kidnapped.“if not for God how will I have
being here celebrating my birthday which happened to be today, having been a victim of kidnappers. So I find it necessary to say a little about my experience and the security challenges we have in the Country.“I was kidnapped in North Central between Kaduna and Nasarawa on my way to Abuja from Adamawa. There were so many of us who were kidnapped and we were divided into groups and priced as a commodity depending on our appearance, the clothes you are putting on and the gadgets you have, such as Phones that we were holding.“The group that took me said I should call my family to bring ransom of N20 million. Luckily, I disguised during the journey and didn’t wear my traditional regalia. I told them I was a driver to one of the vehicles, and also a boy to the main driver. I told them I am the one responsible for my family and that apart from driving, I am also a painter”.“They said if I don’t do what they ask me to do they will deal with me. I then told them that if they wanted to kill me, they use a gun to shoot me to make it fast instead of using a knife which would be painful and take time to die. They then asked if I was the one to tell them how to kill me”.“They named me Baba Painter and after some time they reduced my ransom to N10 million. It is really good to disguise when travelling. I told them my family could not get that kind of money and that I could try for N1 million. When I called my people about the situation, they made a mistake and sent it without delay. The kidnappers now said, no way, my family have money, that I must bring another N1 million. Eventually, I got another N200,000 before I was freed from captivity.“Today, as we speak, in Isa LGA Sokoto State farmers can’t access their farms without paying dues to criminals. Today in Dansadau (Zamfara) you can’t celebrate the naming ceremony of a newborn without approval from criminals.
Today Traditional rulers are targets of criminals.“But as traditional leaders, we are supposed to be the closest to the Government and the Nigerian People. However, we have been dumped aside. It is agreed that we play very critical roles in our communities. We settle cases and other issues.“In every community, I can tell you that we settle between 850 and 890 Disputes monthly. We are coordinators of Customary law. We are organizers of communal labours, festivals and Promoters of socio-economic activities“However, we are constitutionally handicapped. No constitutional responsibilities (power), No salaries. 89% of traditional rulers are volunteers (Ward Heads), without salaries. We also suffer intimidation from the political class (even when they know they are wrong)On the ways by which kidnapping menace can be brought to a stop,  Sarkin Sulaiman said, “There should be a law enabling the creation of traditional institution as the fourth arm of Government.“The law should ensure the merging of the traditional institution with the Judiciary with the return of customary and area Courts under traditional institution.
.
Also, there should be a salary review and enhancement for traditional rulers because everybody in the community comes to the traditional leader for food, sickness, and every problem.Furthermore, “All vigilante and hunters groups should be made to work only in particular areas and under the supervision of a ward head (its original concept) for monitoring and supervision to ensure they don’t deviate into something elseHe said, this way, “All uncultivated land will be managed in a manner where criminals cannot use such spaces for hideouts and kidnapping.“Traditional leaders should also be allowed to ask questions about any suspected persons or movement within their community” There should be open communication lines with other security agencies to properly. This will lead to reducing the gap between urban and rural communities (in terms of
people orientation to ensure an awareness).Emphasizing that an” institution that settles 85% of disputes cannot be said to be asking of too much in terms of remuneration, Sarkin Sulaiman said, “Therefore I would like the traditional leaders here to appreciate Gombe
State Governor Muhammed Inuwa Yahya for reviewing the salaries of traditional Leaders.“He increased salaries for Ward Heads to Level 4, Village Heads to Level 8 and District Heads to Level 12, after understanding the selfless services of the traditional institution which he said is true as the traditional leaders do not only farm for their family but for
their communities. Hence there is hardly any such thing as banditry and kidnapping in that area.Other stakeholders that participated in the dialogue as part of the strategy of engaging across several sectors to understand the root causes of kidnapping and to provide sustainable solutions which will support the efforts of security agencies and policymakers were the media, academia and CSOs."

Today, we gather here with a mix of feelings – relief, joy, and gratitude. We are here to welcome back Treasure Ayuba, the last of the kidnapped students of Bethel Baptist High School, Kaduna, matched out while in their sleep in the school hostel and kidnapped on the night of 5th July 2021 by bandits.”“To the knowledge of CAN, over Two Hundred and Fifty Million (250,000, 000) Naira was paid as ransom to get the 121 kidnapped children out from their captors, but for Treasure, his story became a heart-breaking one, further made worse by distorting the truth that the boy did not want to leave the den of the kidnappers.”“For the avoidance of doubts, CAN is aware of the firm efforts made by the boy’s family, relations, and well-wishers to get him back home. To add salt to injury, on more than one occasion, the kidnappers abducted the persons sent with the ransom to get Treasure out of their hands making his stay become an infinite time of agonising pain until God intervened.”“Accordingly, on Thursday 2nd November 2023 I received a call from Treasure’s parents that the boy returned home safely after being in the hands of his captors for 28 months…. Treasure’s miraculous return is a moment of triumph, not just for Treasure and his family, Bethel Baptist High School Kaduna, the Baptist family, Kaduna state, and Nigeria, but for all humanity in general.”“Treasure’s abduction, along with his fellow schoolchildren, remains a painful reminder of the challenges we face as a nation.

Today, as we stand here, welcoming Treasure back into the loving arms of his family, the church, people of goodwill and the government of Kaduna state, we are reminded of the resilience and determination that defines us as a people irrespective of religious affiliations or ethnic origin.”“In the time of the tragedy of the school children’s kidnap, we refused to let darkness prevail. We were united as a nation, across different backgrounds and beliefs, and worked determinedly to ensure the safe return of these innocent children. Therefore, on behalf of CAN Kaduna State Chapter and all people of goodwill who prayed for the safe return of Treasure, I want to express my deepest gratitude to our security forces, who vigorously worked day and night to ensure the safe rescue of Treasure and his fellow students.”“We must use this moment to renew our commitment to safeguarding the future of our children. We must work together, across all sectors of society, to ensure that no child lives in fear of going to school. To Treasure, I want to say that you are a symbol of strength and resilience. Your bravery throughout this ordeal is an inspiration to us all. As you step back into the embrace of your loved ones, we want you to know that our nation stands with you.

The family of one of the victims, Betty Udofia, is said to have been contacted, and the kidnappers are reportedly demanding an N4 million ransom.HURIWA claimed that the acting IG had given no justification for not giving the rescue of the corps members a top priority.The rights organisation also criticised the president for failing to impose administrative consequences on security chiefs as a result of the pervasive insecurity throughout the nation.According to HURIWA, the IGP would have sent personnel to rescue the kidnapped youth corps members.Although the kidnapping of corpers is a very sensitive issue because it touches on an institution established by the country to promote national cohesion, unity, and to harness the talents, skills, and gifts of young people towards national service, HURIWA reminded those advocating the abolition of the NYSC that kidnappings have become hydra-headed monsters and asserted that Nigerians should be more focused on demanding intelligence-based policing, which is lacking.It added that the rising kidnap incidents show the crime’s “profitability” outweighs the perceived threat of state intervention and police rescues."

Saturday Telegraph gathered that the moment they established contact with the lady’s husband, they demanded that the sum of a hundred thousands dollars ($100,000) be provided as ransom for them to release her.They also warned the family not to report the incident to the police but to cooperate fully with them if they wanted her back alive. “Fortunately for me, they didn’t harm me. They told me they were not going to harm me. They said they just want money from my husband and that if my husband is going to give them money, they will release me.“They went into my account and made away with some of the money I had in my savings. While they kept me there, they were communicating with my husband. At the end of the day, I regained my freedom after a week and a day. They drove me back to a place and called my husband to cone and pick me. They were using my phone for all their communications with my husband.“Before dropping me off, they asked me where I live and I told them. So they now dropped me somewhere on the Kubwa Expressway. They called my husband and told him they will drop me at a particular spot but they didn’t drop me there. They dropped me before the place and asked him to come and pick me. So, that was how my husband came and picked me there and here we are today,” she said.Saturday Telegraph learnt that though the family lodged a complaint at the Police Station as soon as the incident happened, it amounted to nothing. The usual lackadaisical attitude of the Police to incidents of kidnap, missing person, car theft and even armed robbery played out.SURVIVAL STRATEGYOn how she survived the eight traumatic days in the kidnapper’ s den, Rhoda disclosed that surprisingly, her abductors were friendly, didn’t harm her but were giving her food throughout the period.“They would ask me what I wanted to eat. Sometimes I wouldn’t have the appetite; they would give me food and I would not be able to eat it. So, they became concerned about me. You know, I have ulcer, so the thing normally affects my chest when I eat.So I presented it as if it was breast cancer and was using that as a bargaining chip to appeal to them to release me. “They wanted to even buy the drugs for me if I could name them. I also have BP problem.They asked for the names of my drugs and they bought them for me. On one of those days, I had a running stomach. They were concerned, they gave me drugs to calm it down.”COMPASSION OR TACTICSBut were they really concerned about her? Perhaps they showed some concern but were they doing all that to keep her alive because she held the key to their expected fortune. They were waiting for a huge sum of money. It could not be confirmed how much they eventually got, but the fact remains that they cashed out in a big way without the security agencies lifting a finger.Unlike the typical image of kidnap- ers, the lady disclosed that her abductors didn’t look or sound like ruffians Samuel recalled: “They were decent. All of them are graduates. They were very decent looking people. They are young guys with whom I even had to engage in some conversations.“I asked them: Why are you doing this? One of them told me that it is because of the economic situation in the country. They want money because they want to take care of their needs too. They said there is money in the country but a few people are controlling the money. So anyhow, they also want to survive. This kidnapping) is a means of survival for them.So I told them that: Yes, Nigeria has happened to you, Nigeria has also happened to me. I’m also in that divide where you are; I’m also a graduate and I’m still schooling. I have two degrees and I’m undergoing my Master’s programme now. I don’t even have a good job. “My husband is a civil servant too but works with a private firm where they depend on government contracts and the company is not moving. So invariably, there is no money. The kind of money you are demanding – $100,000 – from where do you want us to get that money?I told them: Just take my case as a bad market. They said kidnappers don’t have bad market. At the end of the day, I admonished the one that was talking to me that this (kidnapping business) is not good. “You know these people causing the problem of our country. If you want to get to them, you know where to get them.We are all in the same mess. I’m also suffering the same way you’re suffering. The only difference is that I have not chosen this path. At the end of the day, I requested for a Bible, they gave me one. They were actually good but they are victims of a failed society. “You know that I’m also into research. I’m a social scientist. I’m a political scientist.I could understand the motives behind what is going on in our country. It’s a kind of revolt against a failed system that has turned every- body into what they have become. You know, if the country was actually moving forward, people that are schooled, people that are well learned will not be going through hell. But because of our bad situation, mass unemployment, a lot of people have taken to criminality. I sympathised with them. It’s just unfortunate that I was also a victim of the same thing they were crying about.So, I asked them to stop it, but they said that is what they have chosen. “At the end of the day, when they released me, we prayed together. I told them I don’t have any grudge against them but that they should know that what they are doing is not right. I asked that God should touch their hearts so that they would stop this thing. So they prayed with me.They didn’t beat me. They didn’t molest me. They brought me back in one piece and I’m grateful to God that I’m here today, healthy and alive. ”BENEVOLENT ABDUCTORSAgain the story of Rhoda Samuel was unique because not only were her abductors civil and considerate, they even provided her with some transport fare to go home. “They put N2,000 in my purse. They were actually very good people. At the end of the day, I prayed to God for their lives. I don’t want them to get killed.I want God to arrest them, let them repent of their sins and change for the better. If everybody wants to react against the failed system and everybody picks up arms and starts attacking others, the country will not be safe for anybody. “On the part of the government, those in authority should realise that when the governed are neglected, they would want to do anything to survive.Today, the people in power believe that they have security but it is the same money that is meant for our collective security that they are using for their own personal benefits. They have peo- ple that are guarding them 24 hours a day and they have every- thing that they need to live comfortable lives. They feel that they are secured and do not care about the rest of us. But they are making a mistake.”"

kidnapping,"May 28, 2023",Lagos,"Kidnapping In Lagos Nigeria: When Olugbenga Owolabi an America-based Nigerian decided to invest in the hospitality business in his hometown, Ogbomoso, after several decades of living in the United States of America never in his wildest imagination did it occur to him that singular decision who cost him his life.Unfortunately, what began like a harmless adventure turned into a nightmare when Olugbenga Owolabi was abducted alongside Rachael Opadele a staff of his company on 29 July 2022 at the hotel located in Abaa area of Ogbomoso.Ironically, Owolabi and Rachael Opadele, lives were cut short in August 2022 by their kidnappers after a ransom of N 5 million was paid by Owolabi’s relatives.Rachael Opadele, a student of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Ogbomoso only crime was picking a job to keep l herself busy during the strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).Like Olugbenga Owolabi and Rachael Opadele, many Nigerians have lost their lives, while others narrowly escape death as kidnapping business keeps thriving unhindered in Nigeria.From the South to the East, North to West, kidnapping has transformed into a profitable enterprise, affecting individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds who become targets for ransom demands.Although we typically link kidnapping to criminal syndicates. It’s crucial to acknowledge that this phenomenon can encompass more than just traditional illegal activities.

iStockphotoWe have seen cases of politically motivated kidnappings and individuals faking their kidnap to extort money from their families and relatives.Unfortunately, these occurrences have grown more frequent due to heightened cases of organized crime, political instability and economic woes throughout the country.In this comprehensive guideline, we will delve into the reasons behind the alarming prevalence of this atrocious act in Nigeria and explore the ongoing efforts to mitigate its occurrence.What Is Kidnapping?Kidnapping is a grave crime that involves the forcible transportation of a person from one place to another without their consent and the subsequent confinement against their will for a significant period.Read Also: Kaduna train attack: Terrorists Threaten To Kill Passengers In 24hrs If Demands Are UnmetThis heinous act is universally condemned as a violent infringement upon the fundamental human rights of an individual.Increase In Kidnappings In Lagos, NigeriaKidnappings in Lagos are not limited to any particular demographic group; however, some areas seem more vulnerable than others.For instance, wealthy neighbourhoods such as Ikoyi, Victoria Island, and Lekki have been prime targets for kidnappers. This is primarily due to the high concentration of affluent residents and expatriates living in these areas.Kidnapping has become a significant criminal activity in Lagos, the most populous city in Nigeria and one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa.The city has witnessed a substantial surge in kidnappings in recent years, targeting people from all walks of life, including wealthy business executives, expatriates, politicians, and even schoolchildren.

CFRKidnapping has become not only a security threat to the residents of Lagos but also a significant challenge to the Nigerian government.The presence of multiple security agencies in the state has not deterred kidnapping syndicates, who seem to be more sophisticated and organized than the security forces.Causes Of Crime In NigeriaThe causes of crime in Nigeria are multifaceted and complex, and various factors contribute to the high crime rate in the country. One of the major contributing factors to corruption in Nigeria is poverty.Many Nigerians live below the poverty line, resulting in high inequality, unemployment, and lack of access to essential resources.Another factor contributing to crime in Nigeria is political instability. The country has a history of political unrest, and conflict has created an environment conducive to criminal activities.Finally, Drug abuse is another significant cause of crime in Nigeria. The high rate of drug use among the youth in Nigeria has led to an increasing number of violent crimes, including armed robbery and murder.Effective Solutions To Curb The Crime RateOne of Nigeria’s most crucial remedies for kidnapping is to report the incident to the police immediately. The law enforcement agencies have the mandate to investigate and prosecute kidnappers.

iStockphotoIt is critical to provide the police with accurate and detailed information about the victim, the kidnappers, and the circumstances surrounding the abduction.Another remedy for kidnapping in Nigeria is to engage the services of a reputable security outfit.In a bid to tackle the ugly trend, the Nigerian Senate passed a bill imposing jail terms of at least 15 years for paying a ransom to free someone who has been kidnapped and made the crime of abduction punishable by death in cases where victims die.The bill, which amends Nigeria’s terrorism law, mandates death penalty for convicted kidnappers where the abduction leads to loss of life, and life imprisonment in other cases.Despite making the crime of abduction punishable by death in cases where victims die, and ransom payment punishable with lengthy jail sentences to discourage the rising spate of kidnapping and abduction for ransom in Nigeria nothing seems to have changed.

neusroomThe Final SayFinally, the causes of crime in Nigeria are multifaceted, complex, and varied. To combat crime effectively, policymakers and law enforcement officials must address the causes of crime.This includes poverty, political instability, porous borders, inadequate security forces, and drug abuse by implementing proactive measures to tackle these problems.

The disparities made me suspect foul play, but I decided to let it go and accept fate that my son was dead.”The father noted that the circumstances surrounding his son’s death took another turn when an eyewitness told his eldest son that the deceased was allegedly hit by an official of the Ago motor park when he was preaching on the premises on the day we last spoke with him, which the police confirmed after several back and forth.“When I told the police about the allegation of being hit at the motor park, they said truly they went there but they did not pick him up, and that he had no injuries on his body. Later, when one of the police teams that went to the park was asked to show the pictures taken at the scene, there was blood all over his body.“I queried why they left him alone and how someone drenched in blood could walk that long distance from the park to where his body was found. I moved the case to the Area Command where the Area Commander ordered the arrest of officials of the park where my son was allegedly hit on the head and the police team that went to the park.

some aggrieved students of the school, who staged a protest at Idiroko Police Station, to express their displeasure were allegedly teargassed and beaten by the police.The statement reads, “We, the youth of Ipokia Local Government under the aegis and leadership of Ipokia Local Government Youth Forum (IPYF) are emphatically heartbroken by the sad news we received that a police officer popularly called “FREEDOM” attached to Nigeria Police Force Area Command, Ilaro inhumanly killed one Adeleye Eniola, an SS1 student of Mayigi Community High School, Ilashe in a cold blood hit-and-run and he is currently at large. We strongly condemn this barbaric act in its entirety”.“Over the years, we have been faced with Nigeria Police Force’s unprofessional discharge of their constitutional duties that always infringed on the human rights of our people, and it has always been proven that men of the Police Force on our roads in Ipokia Local Government are specially trained to kill, maim, extort our people and take away our rights as citizens of this country”.“The said officer named “FREEDOM” was reportedly chasing a motorist that escaped extortion while he killed the young girl and had other students injured in his unethical daily activities. This is one of many misconducts of policemen on Owode-Idiroko road”.“The said officer left Ilaro, to perpetrate the evil act in Ipokia Local Government because the Nigeria Policemen had been left unchecked and they have turned themselves into free rascals that can operate even outside their jurisdictions.“Sadly, the students that lost one of their own to police rascality went to Idiroko Police station in protest for the death of their colleagues was faced with a quite unfortunate situation when men of Idiroko Police Station teargassed and beat the protesting students, which led to the arrest of some of our comrades that were sent to manage the situation, it took several interventions before they were released to us.“Over time, these had been the mode of operation of men of Nigeria Police Force in Ipokia Local Government where they mount illegal checkpoints on our roads to extort our people, take bribes on our roads and threaten to kill our people by putting guns to their faces. Now, this is just a revelation of their uncivil discharge of duties in Ipokia Local Government that had claimed several lives and destruction of properties we have lost count of.“Similarly, while all these animalistic and inhumane behaviours of the policemen were playing out; the men of Joint Task Force (JTF) were deployed to arrest the chaos, but they engineered more harm by entering into Mayigi Community High School, Ilashe to destroy properties of the school and dwellers in the vicinity to the tune of millions of naira, while pointing guns to the head teachers and students; trying to kill them with guns that were procured with our taxes.“However, it’s evident that a pig would always remain a pig. All security forces docile within our Local Government had proven beyond reasonable doubt that they had been sent to kill us and not to protect us or perform their statutory duties.“To this end, we call on all those concerned to speed up interventions as this issue might metamorphose into derailment that would further fuel and orchestrate pandemonium between our people and the concerned security formations in our Local Government.“To avert this ugly situation, here are our humble requests that must be met wholly or else the Nigeria Police Force in Ipokia Local Government should be ready for another ENDSARS; here are our requests; the hit-and-run officer must be properly identified”.He should be prosecuted for manslaughter and inciting public unrest. All illegal checkpoints on our roads should be disbanded immediately as it’s evident that Area Commands and Divisions are not meant to mount checkpoints.“Conclusively, if our demands are not met; we will be forced to mobilize the strongest and finest of our youths both at home and in diaspora as we will be matching against these bloodsucking vampires in uniform as the next knock on your doors would be our comrade headquarters.”Several calls put through to the Ogun State Police Command Public Relations Officer, SP Omolola Odutola, were unanswered at the time of filing this report."

murder,"October 9, 2023",Delta,"There is palpable fear in Ubulu-Uku, Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State, as gunmen shot dead a member of Ubulu-Uku Vigilance group.Nigeriacrime.com also learned that a 76-year-old woman, Theresa Okocha,  was beaten to death in her house at Agbonta Quarters in the same town.At the time of filling this report, members of the vigilance group and hunters were combing the bushes.A community source, Ikechukwu, said,” Today, Monday, October 9, a member of Ubulu-Uku Vigilance group, Sule, from Isho Quarters, had resumed duty on Ubulu-Uku-Isele-Uku road, but he didn’t know that gunmen had laid ambush on him, so. as he was changing his clothes, to his official uniform, a man shot him in his head and he died before help could come. The killing of Sule angered his colleagues and hunters who started combing the bushes in search of the brigands.” I must confess, Ubulu-Uku is under heavy attack by criminals. Just last week, a man was abducted almost at the same place that Sule was shot. Two weeks ago, another victim was kidnapped. We are in our worst trying moment.On the murder of Okocha, she was living alone in her compound, but was found unconscious in her room with bruises all over her body and serious injuries on her face, but she was unable to tell what happened to her.One of her relatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the woman might have been unconscious for days,” it was after about two days that people noticed that Aunty Theresa, as she is fondly called, had not been coming out from her house for about two days, so neighbours became worried and decided to check on her, only to see her lying unconscious on the floor. Her body was full of bruises, showing that she was beaten up or attacked . We decided to rush her to the hospital. Unfortunately, she died a few days in the hospital, but she was unable to tell her stories.” But with swollen mouth, eyes and bruises all over her body, her attacker beat her up. She was seriously beaten, but I don’t understand why she was not able to shout or raise the alarm as her closest neighbours claimed that they did not hear any sign of quarrel or scuffle. Well, the motive behind her killing is baffling.” Her death has caused serious panic in our once peaceful and serene community. I don’t know what is going on in our community. Ubulu-Uku used to be peaceful. I don’t know whether it is because of development in the community that many atrocities are happening. A few months ago, a young promising footballer, was shot dead in a popular restaurant by suspected Cultists. There are constant reports of burglaries.All these are strange developments that the Obi in Councils and Ubulu-Uku Development Union should look into. We can’t fold our arms and watch Ubulu-Uku go down in this evil way. Everybody is in serious panic, we are seeing evil in once a peaceful community.” I am, therefore, sending a serious appeal to the Obi in Councils, to do the needful, using the traditional ways to stop the menace of criminals in the community. Let them place curses on the evil doers, so that the menace will cease to exist. We know that there is a particular village that is known for raining curses.The people should be contacted. Again, I am appealing to Aniocha-South LGA chairman, Pastor Jude Chukwuwike, to do the needful by empowering our vigilante groups so that they will carry out their duty deligently.

But it is criminal to attempt to claim that you are from Lagos when you are not. It is what the police should take up, arrest the said candidates and try them,” Omotoso said, adding that “it is perjury and is punishable under the law of the land.”Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army confirmed the arrest of the six candidates.A statement on Wednesday by the Director,  Army Public Relations,  Maj.

The video is a pointer to one of the processes to which the candidates were subjected to ensure only true indigenes of a particular State are recruited, using the slots of that state and non-indigenes.“The video in itself, therefore, clearly shows that the process is transparent, as the State Representative, who is a prominent member of the recruitment team has been part and parcel of the process and was given unhindered access to do her job by scrutinizing the candidates’ State of origin, to ascertain the genuineness of their indigeneship claims.”Onyema said an investigation will be conducted to determine fraudulent activities and to identify those behind the fraudulent act.“The state representative must identify non-indigenes amongst candidates applying for recruitment and this is applicable in other states of the federation.“We wish to inform the general public that the fraudulent act perpetrated by the three candidates who attempted to secure vacancies designated for candidates with Lagos State indigeneship is a serious breach of our recruitment process and will not be condoned.“We want to assure the public that a thorough investigation will be conducted to ascertain the extent of these fraudulent activities and to identify any individual(s) or unscrupulous syndicate(s) involved. We are dedicated to ensuring that only the most qualified and deserving candidates are selected to serve in the NA,” the statement added."

The sample of the product was taken to our laboratory for analysis and was found to contain heavy metals identified as mercury.“The Crusader soap is falsely labelled as ‘Made in England’ to deceive Nigerians, while the actual source is India. This is an outright violation of the NAFDAC Act and a contravention of the agency’s regulations, including the Cosmetic Products (Prohibition of Bleaching Agents) Regulations 2019,” she stated.The NAFDAC boss stressed that the presence of mercury in cosmetics has sparked global concern because of the established and documented health hazards it poses to human health and the environment.She said the arrested suspects will be charged in court while intensifying the manhunt for the fleeing members of the syndicate."

However, these candidates only succeed in manipulating what they are holding, as the authentic results are with the Board and would be transmitted to their schools of choice at the appropriate time.“It is to be noted that Miss Mmesoma Ejikeme had sent a message to the Board’s platform to request her UTME result, after which she manually inflated her scores and pasted same on the 2022 UTME result sheet. Unknown to her, the Board had changed the design of the 2023 UTME result sheet. Her original result remains 249, as nothing can change that. With this her ignoble act, Miss Mmesoma would be prosecuted and her original result withdrawn. This is not all, as the Board would, in due course, investigate all candidates laying claims to higher scores than they actually obtained. Once discovered, such candidates’ original results would be withdrawn forthwith, and they would be handed over to relevant security agencies for prosecution.”"

No wonder the unveiling was quick, no details were made available, no one has the eyes to say he saw any features of the plane or anything.”“He also made known that the airline was yet to secure an operating licence for full flight operations, disagreeing with earlier declarations of the former Minister, Hadi Sirika.”“This explains why the Minister was so adamant and insisted on going ahead with the unveiling of the Nigerian Air even when there was a court order acting against that same matter because it’s a half-baked project, driven by lies, deception, corruption and personal money benefits to the Minister amounting to billions of Naira.”“This is deception and breach of trust that should not go unpunished, Hadi Sirika must be brought to face the law.
It is also a disregard for the rule of law and the entire justice system to proceed on the matter against the order of a competent court of law.”“The Minister has acted with so much impunity on several occasions as if the law cannot get to him, he has continuously operated as a tyrant Minister, refusing to listen to no one, the  aviation experts, Airline Operators of Nigeria, AON, who advised against this project.”“This national embarrassment and waste of resources incurred on the country would have been averted if he had listened to advices, yet Sirika went ahead knowing it was a charade, to deceive Nigerians and pocket billions for himself.”"

Victims sent money to the defendants through a complex web of U.S.-based former victims.The defendants convinced these former victims to receive money from new victims and then forward the fraud proceeds to others (thereby serving as so-called “money mules”).In pleading guilty, the defendants admitted to defrauding over $6 million from more than 400 victims, many of whom were elderly or otherwise vulnerable.“The Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch will pursue, prosecute, and secure the convictions of transnational criminals responsible for defrauding U.S. consumers, wherever they are located. I thank the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency for its extensive efforts in helping to ensure that these defendants are held accountable here in the United States,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.“The Justice Department and U.S. law enforcement will continue to work closely with law enforcement partners across the globe to bring to justice criminals who attempt to defraud U.S. victims from outside the United States.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) has a long tradition of protecting American citizens from these types of schemes and bringing those responsible to justice,” said Postal Inspector in Charge Juan A. Vargas of the USPIS Miami Division.“These guilty pleas are a testament to the dedicated partnership between the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to protect our citizens from these scams.”“These guilty pleas are a result of the unwavering commitment and countless hours spent by HSI and our law enforcement partners to ensure that this investigation led the extradition of the two Nigerian nationals,” said Special Agent in Charge Scott Brown of HSI Arizona.“Operating a transnational inheritance fraud scheme that targets the elderly is not only morally reprehensible, it also undermines the financial systems we use and depend upon. I thank everyone who worked on this case. These two defendants are one step closer to facing much-deserved prison time.”On May 18, Ozor pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Abraham pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud earlier today. Ozor is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams on July 27. Judge Williams will sentence Abraham on August 9. Both defendants face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.The Consumer Protection Branch, USPIS, and HSI are investigating the case.Senior Trial Attorney Phil Toomajian and Trial Attorneys Josh Rothman and Brianna Gardner of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, Europol, and authorities from the U.K., Spain, and Portugal all provided critical assistance."

The husband had been beating her before she died today. He used to beat her up. We believe the physical assault caused damage to her health, considering her condition. She had given birth to six children for this man. This was her seventh pregnancy before she died. She died during the pregnancy.“Just yesterday (Monday), my late sister told one of our sisters that her husband and his elder brother used to beat her up. She alleged that she didn’t have peace of mind in the house and that both of them were making life miserable for her. That she could no longer walk.“Before she made her complaint known yesterday (Tuesday), there had been several complaints that the beating was too much. I told my parents that they should take her away from the house. But whenever she left her husband, she would return the second day.”Idowu, in his reaction on Tuesday, said his late wife’s family is cooking lies against him based on the false information that Deborah had fed them with.He said, “It is not true. I was the one who took her to the hospital. She wasn’t feeling well. When we took her to a private hospital, they were the ones who transferred us to the General Hospital. I didn’t beat her. The only issue that took us to the police station earlier was between her and my mother. She fought my mother and my younger siblings.

My brother didn’t touch her at all. It was even my brother and I who were taking her to the hospital when she started feeling unwell.“Despite the way she used to insult my brother, he still followed us to the hospital. The people are just saying all these things just because of the issue that came up between us a long time ago.”Contacted, the spokesperson for the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, Joke Ladenegan-Oginni, said the agency had yet to receive any information regarding the issue while urging the family to report the case.She said, “There is little we can do if you don’t report it.

He holds a Bachelor’s degree in International Studies from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, a Master’s Degree in Criminal Justice Studies and Policing from the University of Leeds, United Kingdom (on British Government Chevening Scholarship) and a Diploma in National Security from the Centre for Strategic Studies, Galilee International Management Institute, KibutzMizra, Israel. He has also attended the Global Peace Operations Initiative Course in Vicenza, Italy; the US State Department Law Enforcement Executive Development Programme in Gaborone, Botswana; and the British Council Interaction Leadership Programme (2nd Cohort).In this interview with Nigeriacrime.com correspondent, CP Idowu Owohunwa talked about recent projects and activities to checkmate gender based violence sexual abuse and human rights abuse in Lagos State.What he is doing about gender based violence and sexual abuse in the state?Let me start with the soft one which is also my passion, gender based violence. I am sure you are already aware of the actions I have taken to really upscale the capacity of our gender unit. If you are not, what I have done on my assumption of office here is to relocate our gender unit from the Command and as at this moment, we are working with the office of the first lady in Ogun State and some NGOs to remodel and modernise the facility. By the time we are done with that facility, we will have hostel facilities for even some complainants. In developing this concept, our partners drew our attention to the fact that some victims of domestic violence, who report, might be scared of going back to that same place to avoid possible anger or assault by their spouse. So we are creating hostels for them, within the few days it will take to resolve their issues.The ward will contain about forty people. It will have both the children’s area and the restaurant area. They will have a call centre, we have safe custody for those that would be held there. There will be case management offices, a psychological support unit and a legal unit.It is going to be a national standard if not a global standard; we are working with some NGOs.  The remodelling has started; I do hope it will be completed before I exit Lagos State.The only thing we are saying is that, with that capacity upstaged, the natural consequence would be that there will be more complaints because the confidence in the police to handle such issues will also be enhanced so people will have more confidence to come out and complain. In fact, to me, gender-based violence, sexual abuse, and family-related violence are one of the highest crimes in Lagos, unfortunately, it is not fully reported because of sociocultural factors.What about Human rights, what is the command doing about that?So, Human Rights, yes I am concerned too with. I am trying within my leadership capabilities, bit by bit, we can get there. We have established the Complaint Response Unit. There is a section in the Police Act 2020 that makes provision for the establishment of a complaint response unit that should be replicated in all states at the state level. Unfortunately, no state Command has established it. Lagos State is taking the lead. We have established it, we have furnished it. It is going to be fully automated. We will have computers, we are partnering with (mobile, they have installed the software; they are in the last phase of their training.So the idea is that there is a gap already if a policeman is misbehaving on the streets, you pick up your phone and call his CP if you know him. What if you don’t know the CP or the DPO? So we have acquired six dedicated lines. It is also active on social media like Twitter and Facebook, even WhatsApp. There is also a webpage. So anywhere such happens, you will call in and the software is such that if you call any of the numbers, it can circulate through the six numbers that we have so whichever one is free, we transfer it, and then they will receive the message.If it is something they have to attend to, immediately, they will, if it is something that has to be investigated then we refer it to the appropriate department. They will investigate to give feedback. So, it’s an accountability mechanism, it is not to witch-hunt anybody. I told the officers, it is to hold them accountable for their actions. Any policeman doing the right thing should not be afraid."

Together, we can salvage our State from this destructive menace.”In her reaction, the APWECON Governor, Mrs. Matilda Ajibola Shipeolu, commended the state government for the enlightenment adding that it will further ensure a firm and strong foundation for a violence-free home.Sipeolu stressed that the training had improved their knowledge of new techniques on how to reduce domestic violence in society, which she stressed was part of the agenda of the association."

The semen shouldn’t look like water.Healthy and normal semen is typically a white, creamy, and thick fluid. The consistency of the semen varies from person to person.Semen is made up of water, zinc, vitamin C, protein, sugar, and prostaglandins. The fluid mostly consists of mucus, plasma, and water.For most men, the texture and taste of the semen depend on:Diet
Water intake
Medication use
Smoking
Alcohol consumptionSo, varying textures in semen are quite natural – especially if they happen infrequently.What does watery sperm mean?When the semen is too watery and runny, it could mean you have a low sperm count, which can be an indicator of fertility issues. Thick, cloudy, and white semen often has a better sperm count than clear and watery semen.But, in many cases, this runniness and watery consistency might be a transient issue that resolves on its own. For example, men who ejaculate very often can have clear and runny semen.Abstaining from sex or masturbation for a couple of days might lead to chunkier, thicker, and whiter semen.However, there are many other factors that can make the sperm watery. Some can affect sperm function and overall health."

The Nwachukwus therefore called on the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Idowu Owohunwa, to arrest and prosecute their daughter’s husband, one Bakare, for allegedly brutalising their pregnant daughter.The family alleged that the beating started soon after the said Bakare got married to their daughter, despite the fact that she was pregnant and carrying his unborn baby. Speaking with journalists yesterday in Lagos on behalf of the family, Favour Nwachukwu, alleged that they have reported the case to the police in Bariga.She said Bakare cannot hide behind a call for search for his missing wife, whereas the police is aware of the alleged ill-treatment, which she said is often meted out to her sister by her husband According to Favour, the call for the arrest and prosecution of Bakare, is sequel to a false and malicious publication credited to him in one of the national dailies alleging that he is in search for his missing wife.Favour said the account of Bakare is not only misleading but must not be believed by anyone. She said: “In the report, Bakare claimed that his pregnant wife, Faith, left home since January 2023 and had not returned since then.” According to her, Bakare alleged that his wife left for the market on the day she was last seen, but that contrary to that the family believes that Bakare was just being clever by half after he had allegedly inflicted pains and injuries the wife.“It is on record that the case has been reported at Bariga Police Station. It is true that, presently, we do not know the whereabout of Faith, but what we also know is that my sister had complained severally of the brutish treatment meted to her by Bakare on several occasions and that he might kill her one day.“The couple got married about a year ago and shortly after that the music changed. He claimed that the family’s stance is because he is a Muslim.

She said he told her repeatedly that she was just a baby mama.He said: “There was a time he sent the children and I out of the house and abandoned us for almost a year.

“He said I should be addressing him as sir.“He complained about my dressing and called my sister a barren woman.”Adeola recounted that her marriage became stormy after her husband left Malaysia and returned to Nigeria.She did not know that he returned to Nigeria and secretly married a new wife, she alleged.She said that after he returned to Nigeria, she noticed disturbing changes in Ikechukwu, with his character allegedly morphed into a wife beater and a verbal assaulter.Read Also: Corruption: Dep Director, NAPTIP, 4 others dismissedHe started interrogating her if she withdraws as much as N20,000 from her bank account.The couple had been married for 17 years before things began to fall apart.Adeola said that she currently lives and sleeps in her shop, while Ikechukwu allegedly has about six houses in Lagos.She recounted: “He sent me out of the house and took our four children since last year.“He set me up and then lied that I had an affair with the Uber driver that used to drive me, which is not true.”One of the interesting aspects of the couple’s quarrel is that Ikechukwu now sends videos of himself and his new wife to Adeola, which usually gets her further agitated.Ikechukwu’s lawyer, Barrister Chimezie Onwuama, said: “Mrs. Onwukwe has a very loose relationship with the truth.“Did she inform you that she has been represented by Falana and Falana Chambers in this matter?“If there was a valid claim of domestic violence, Mr. Falana would have ensured she had a remedy.“The matter was adjudicated at the Customary Court and she was directed to file a claim at the High Court.“Till date she has not taken any legal action.“She’s a violent woman.”When the reporter asked if the matter should have been taken to the Customary Court or Family Court, Onwuama said Customary Court because the marriage was consummated under native law and custom.He added: “I am aware that Mrs. Onwukwe has been trying to go to the media, but the matter is in court.“Instead of her to talk to her lawyer, she’s going to the media.“She’s messing up the work of her lawyer.“She brought a marriage certificate, but in the matter before the Customary Court, they filed an objection based on the existence of that marriage certificate and we have found out and we did our research, where they claimed such a marriage happened and the Registrar claimed that there was no record of such a marriage occurring.“The court asked her to bring the Certified True Copy of the marriage certificate and till today she has not brought it.“We can’t say it was forged.“We can only infer that it was forged or fraudulent.“It is a matter of dissolution of marriage and the court says it has to go to the High Court.“She has gone to Falana and Falana is more than capable of handling the matter.“She has never said she was beaten up and had never denied that she had an affair.“She abandoned the children, and she wouldn’t tell you that.Read Also: Kidnaping: Nigerians most

Mr. Onwukwe.“If you need more details, you can get Falana.“If there was a case of domestic violence, I am sure Falana would have done a thorough job.“Mrs. Onwukwe has not been sincere with Falana Chambers.“She had an affair with her Uber driver, but because of the children, we don’t want something that will become a scandal.“I don’t think Mr. Onwukwe and Mrs. Onwukwe are ripe for divorce and we are looking at how to mediate.“It is an ongoing conversation.“She’s claiming that he first went to marry a second wife, and that’s why she did her own, to pay him back.“Two wrongs can’t make a right.“A woman can’t say she was going to have an affair to punish her husband, especially in our country.“The two of them still love each other.“She attacked me several times and then tried to stab me with a pen.“She’s very violent.“In fact, the court ordered her to go for psychiatric treatment because she has been going for psychiatric treatment at Yaba, even before she started having issues with her husband.“The woman is not well.”The matter has also gone to the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, which wrote a referral letter asking the Office of Public Defenders to ensure that legal action through Family Court intervention is taken to ensure that the children were adequately protected.Ikechukwu via letter dated January 17, 2023 was invited by the OPD.A medical report dated January 24, 2023, addressed to Femi Falana Chambers by Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Lagos, stated that Adeola came to the facility on January 12, 2023 following a recommendation for her to get a psychiatric assessment.The report reads in part: “Patient was duly assessed and had a normal psychiatric evaluation.“She also had a personality assessment done which revealed a passive-aggressive personality for which she will continue to have supportive therapy.“This would enable her resilience in the face of current marital challenges.“We recommend that the patient is given custody of her children as she is psychotically and financially capable to take adequate care of them.“As this will help ameliorate the trauma of taking her children, which triggered this passive-aggressive coping mechanism.”The Programmes Officer of the ACVPN, Blessing Aderemi, said Adeola shows all the signs of emotional and psychological abuse.Aderemi said that videos sent to Adeola by Ikechukwu were used to cause mental torture because he knew that the woman still loves him.Read Also: Court adjourns N10bn suit against Abuja school over Keren-Happuch’s deathAderemi said that in her professional evaluation and opinion, the law should be followed and the children, who are all minors, be given to their mum.She also expressed concern that if Ikechukwu continue sto play hide and seek games with Adeola, using the children as a weapon to hurt her, she could harm herself.She further said: “I called Ikechukwu and he told me to go and talk to his lawyer, that the case was already in court.“I told him that no Customary Court will get involved in a case that has to do with children.“He said that he married her traditionally, so he went to Customary Court.“I told him that it is only the Family Court that has jurisdiction over such a case.“He said that he has taken his children and nothing would happen.“I asked him if the way he took the children was the proper way, and he said that Ajiwe Police Station has investigated the matter.“I told him that the police should have charged the matter to court with the evidence he claimed to have against his wife so that the court will decide who the children, who are minors, should be with.“He said that the police had decided that, that he has relocated to Owerri, that he has nothing anymore to do in Lagos, and that if anyone wanted to make a case with him, they should come to Owerri.“I reminded him that everything that happened concerning his wife and children happened in Lagos.“I asked him if he knows about the Child Rights Law, and he said that he was a complete African man, that I should not tell him anything, that he has done what he wanted to do, and that nobody can hold him for that.“He said that very soon, all the children would be moved to the UK.“The truth is that he’s not supposed to take the children out of Nigeria without the consent of his wife and he is not supposed to take the children from their mother, to give them to another woman.“He claimed she was cheating and following men.“But he has another wife and started another life.”Aderemi opined that accusing Adeola of having affairs and having a psychiatric challenge was to discredit and push her out of her matrimonial home.She added: “If Adeola gets her children back, she will be fine, she’ll move on with her life.“The children should be a comfort to her from the trauma she’s going through.“But the husband is adamant and appears not ready to respect the law.“He keeps saying he has taken his children and that there was nothing anyone could do.“He said that each office has a price and that for any office he was taken to, he would pay their price.“This means he has been bribing all police stations.“He was very bold.”Our Reporter contacted the spokesman of the Lagos State Police Command, Benjamin Hundeyin, to find out why Ajiwe Police Station did not charge the matter to a Family Court, why Woman Police Abosede slapped Adeola and why the police assisted in ousting Adeola out of her matrimonial home.Hundeyin said: “According to the DPO Ajiwe Police Station, the matter brought to the station was not about children custody, that he doesn’t have a right to decide who is to take a child anywhere.“The complaint that was brought to the station was a case of stealing.“Mr. Onwukwe complained that because he stays overseas, anytime he comes home, he would discover that things were missing.“It was while investigating the stealing that they now stumbled on the fact that the woman was having an affair with an Uber driver.“The husband got angry and came to the station to challenge the Uber driver, almost believing that it was the man that was taking the things that were missing.“The Uber driver apologised, saying that he didn’t know that the woman was married.“The husband decided to forgive him and let him go since it has not been proven that he stole anything.“The only thing that could be proven was that he had an affair.“The woman did not like the humiliation she suffered; she then went to the Area Command to complain that the DPO was not handling the case well.“The Area Commander asked the DPO to transfer the case and it was transferred, but nothing new was discovered.“How Mr. Onwukwe now took children away was not known to the police.”The police also denied that a policewoman slapped Adeola at the station in the presence of her husband.Hundeyin also said that no policeman packed Adeola’s things out of her matrimonial home as she alleged."

domestic-violence,"March 27, 2024",Lagos,"Members of an Igbo socio-political group, Ndigbo Buru’Otu Association, have raised alarm over the indiscriminate demolition of houses carried out by officials of Federal Housing Authority in Ijeododo community, Ijegun area of Lagos State.They stated that they were shocked over the demolition of their properties last Thursday by the authorities and described the exercise as “heart-wrenching.”Addressing pressmen over the demolition, the Chairman of the Association Eze Chika Nwokedi said: “Our people are angry because they bought lands worth over a billion naira, erected structures and built houses with their hard earned money only to wake one morning and watch it being demolished.”He explained that over 500 members contributed to purchase the vast acres of land since 2017. According to him, we followed due process in acquiring the land from the Baale. “There was proper documentation and family receipts were issued to everyone who bought from the right source verified by FHA. No prior notice was given by FHA nor did the Baale who sold the land to us informed us about any notice of demolition.”Lamenting Nwokedi asked, “Is it now a crime to buy land from the king of a community?I am pained because Igbos within and outside my jurisdiction of leadership approached me to verify a genuine land as their leader and I led them through the appropriate source ‘the Baale’ who in turn issued family receipt only to find out later that the land is not genuinely owned by the ruling family but FHA”“When I asked those carrying out the demolition, they confirmed a notice has been passed since 2022 and they must carry on with the assignment. Right now, FHA is working on the land and has claimed it. We need to hear from the government, we want a refund of money spent on structures destroyed as well as get our lands back. The Baale needs to tell us what he truly knows as regards the demolition and create a working solution as some members are already contemplating suicide.”A member of the association who owns three plots of land in the affected area, Martins Chikeze lamented that: “At the point of purchase, Baale affirmed the land belongs to his family, now FHA is claiming the same land. I appeal to the Federal Government to give the lands back to us as plans are underway to build a small home for my family to avoid threats of quit notice or displacement.”Reacting to the complaints of members of the Association in his palace, the Baale of Ijeododo, High Chief Abu-Jelili Ayinde Ododo and his executives denied involvement and knowledge of the demolition.  He said: “One Mr Lawal who is a FHA Surveyor accompanied by some people visited my palace in 2024 claiming their land is extended to some areas in Ijeododo. After several meetings, FHA representatives said houses marked won’t be demolished but those unmarked are on the roads or blocking a canal. Based on this explanation, I asked for a solution to those unmarked and they requested receipt from the buyers as a way to avoid demolition.”The Baale expressed disappointment at the sudden demolition after proffering solution to avoid it, affirming that he is genuinely bothered by the recent development. He also urged affected persons to be calm assuring that he is in control of the situation as well as gathering vital information."

Their names were then struck out remaining only the ex-NASS member.After the submission of written addresses by both counsel, the court found Oyebamji guilty of all three counts despite his defence that he was admitted to the UCH, Ibadan on 17th December 2019 and discharged on January 18, 2020.The court did not grant his defence describing it as an after-thought.The court said, “The accused person only tendered his photograph with crutches and, neck girdle, without a vehicle inspection report of the accident. There was no photo of the accident vehicle to support his defence. The alibi according to decided authorities must have been promptly and lucidly disclosed to the police during the investigation. It is the considered opinion of this court that the alibi is an after-thought which cannot avail the accused person”.The Chief Magistrate Salami held that “the evidence, both oral and written, weighed against the defendant. So, the prosecution had manifestly proved its case against the defendant. The 7th accused person is therefore found guilty and is accordingly convicted”.The defendant’s counsel pleaded for leniency, saying “I apply to the magnanimity of the court to temper justice with mercy. All along the proceedings, the convict had suffered greatly by having to be remanded in police custody. He is a family man whose dependents will suffer greatly if he is thrown into the Correctional Centre. He has children still schooling, and he is a political figure. I shall be praying the court to award an option of fine as there is no record of his being a convict before”.He was later sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment with an option of N500,000."

When things became so difficult for me, I went to the Nigerian embassy in Russia. At the embassy, I got in contact with the Pathfinder Foundation which rehabilitates and integrates victims of trafficking.  They promised to rehabilitate and integrate me back into society when I get back to Nigeria.“I was seven months pregnant when I came back to Nigeria in September 2015. I gave birth in December 2015, to a mixed-race baby in our family house but because I needed financial help, I reached out to Ruth Idahosa, the founder of the NGO and she assisted me with an apartment when my daughter was about six months old.  She helped her get into creche.”Explaining further, Omoruyi said, “about a year later, Ruth Idahosa asked her sister Daisy who runs a school in Abuja to give me a job in their school. Immediately Daisy met my daughter, she liked and took her to live with her while I was employed as a bus assistant at the Church of God Mission International School, Abuja, where my daughter was enrolled.“Later she changed my daughter’s name from Svetta Omoruyi to Sofia Idahosa without my consent. It was when she started school that I discovered her name had been changed. All the while my daughter lived with them, I never knew Daisy’s house. I only saw my daughter during school hours. She was less than two years old when Daisy took her and she lived with them till she was 4 years old.“I thought they were just helping my daughter and I. I didn’t know they had ulterior motives. When I suspected so, I demanded that my daughter come live with me. When they released her to me, they stopped being responsible for her school fees which I have been paying.“Sometime around April/May 2023, my daughter had a toilet infection. I took her to the hospital for treatment and she was examined by the doctor and treated. It was infection treatment that they are using against me.   However, trouble started two months ago when I was arrested. I was accused of keeping mum over the allegation that my daughter was molested by my ex-boyfriend Samuel Adams.“Police officers from Force Criminal Investigations Department, FCID, Speccial Investigations Unit, Area 10, came to school to arrest Samuel and I. My daughter was taken to social welfare service and is still there to date. I have been denied access to her.“After spending four days in detention, I was released. The police said that my 6-year-old daughter, Svvetta, retracted her initial statement that I was aware of the molestation. It is obvious that my daughter is being tutored on what to say per time. Unfortunately, Samuel is still being held in police custody for two months without being charged to court for a crime he didn’t commit.“Because the police have refused to properly investigate the case, the life of a young promising and hardworking young man is on the line.  I am, therefore, calling on the Inspector General of Police and well-meaning Nigerians to come to Samuel’s rescue.   An innocent person should not rot in police custody.  I also want to have access to my daughter.” she stated.When contacted through a text message, Ruth Idahosa said: “Kindly ensure that our side is included in the narrative you published, as is your ethical and legal obligation.

We will not be making any further statements on this matter.”However, when contacted, the Public Relations Officer, FCID EGUAOJE FUNMILAYO said:  “I don’t know why he is still in detention, but if you want to make enquiries, call me on Monday.

His offences contravened Sections 137 and 261 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.After calling six witnesses in proof of its case, the Director of Public Prosecution, Babajide Martins, informed the court that the prosecution was ready to close its case.The defendant through his counsel, Babatunde Ogala (SAN), subsequently informed the court that the defence had filed a no-case submission.However, while ruling on the application moved by another of his counsel, Mr. Olusegun Fabunmi (SAN), the court held that it was inclined to agree with the prosecution witnesses and their testimonies.Justice Oshodi said, “I have carefully listened to the submissions of both prosecution and defence. In this case, six witnesses testified for the prosecution and various exhibits were tendered in evidence”.“At this stage, I am not to decide whether the evidence presented is believed or not. I am not to decide the credibility or the way to attack the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses but what I am obligated to do at this stage is to decide whether something has been produced so far to prove this case worthwhile”.“The learned SAN has pointed out some evidence he considered as discrepancies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses but I am afraid I am unable to give such an opinion regarding the discrepancies at this stage in a no case context”.“I am inclined to agree with the prosecution, I do believe that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses namely PW1 to 6 and the exhibits tendered thus far has made it worthwhile to continue the trial.“The no case submission is overruled and accordingly, the defendant is hereby called upon to open his defense.”In the ‘no case submission’ dated February 21,2023, Fabunmi had argued that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence against the defendant to warrant him to enter defence.

He said the prosecution also tendered 21 exhibits to prove its case against the defendant.He argued that there was no doubt about the identity of the defendant, as the survivor gave account of how she was asked to suck the defendant’s penis.”The issue that PW2 does not know when the incident happens does not arise. The testimony of the under age girl (survivor) corroborated what the prosecution alleged the defendant of. The evidence of PW3 also corroborated.”The law is settled, the probative value in accordance to section 24 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law. The defendant did not even say he did not live in that house. The girl was 15 years and not below 14 years as at that time.”We have alleged defilement by penetration, tendered exhibits as well as documentary evidence. Even when the survivor was cross- examined by the learned silk, as to her being defiled during her menstrual circle, she responded that the defendant knows her menstrual time.

He was also said to have been married four times.The survivor’s mom explained that due to the hours she leaves and returns home, it was pretty much difficult to know what was happening to her little girl.She said: “I used to leave home by 4:am to sell food. I leave them at home to prepare for school and when they return from school, they come to the shop to join me. I usually leave them with their 14 years old brother. One day my neighbour said I should ask my daughter, who used to put a hand into her bum bum. I asked my neighbour if my daughter told her anything, and she said no. I finally asked my daughter, and she told me that the man used to take her into the kitchen and put his hand on her private part. She told me that it has been happening since we moved into the compound, which was in May 2022.

The mom leaves home at 4:am, when then does she has time to attend to the children? Parents should sit up when it comes to their children. The man comes when the survivor’s mom is not around, he would then takes the child to the kitchen upstairs and violates her. It has been going on for a long time; not once, not twice. My advice to parents is that no matter the issue you’re facing, please take care of your children. The law should also make it easier for this kind of mom and the survivor to get justice on time. The more defilement and rape cases drag in courts, the more people continue to lose interest in going to court or seeking justice.”"

abuse,"November 19, 2022",Benue,"The Court of Appeal in Makurdi has upheld the conviction of Felicia Ogbuja by a Federal High Court for failing to protect the late Ochanya Ogbanje from allegedly being repeatedly raped by her husband and son.Ochanya, who was a JSS1 pupil of the Federal Government Girls College Gboko in Benue State, died on October 17, 2018, of complications linked to alleged repeated rape.It will be recalled that while the Benue State High Court in Makurdi, on April 28, 2022, acquitted Mr Andrew Ogbuja, a lecturer at the Benue State Polytechnic, Ugbokolo, of rape and causing the death of Miss Ogbanje, the Federal High Court in Makurdi, in a separate case on the same day, convicted Mr Ogbuja’s wife (Felicia) for negligence.The Federal High Court Judge, Mobolaji Olajuwon, found Mrs Ogbuja guilty of failing to protect the deceased girl from her husband and son in a case brought before the court in 2019 by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons, NAPTIP.Delivering judgement on the appeal via Zoom, on Friday, the Court of Appeal in Makurdi, agreed with the Federal High Court that Mrs Ogbuja failed in her duty to protect Ochanya from the “sexual exploitation” of her husband and son.The three-member panel led by Justice Hassan Muslim dismissed Mrs Ogbuja’s argument that the charge upon which she was convicted and sentenced was unknown to law.The court held that “the conviction endures on appeal once it is shown by the facts on which the appellant is convicted constitute an offence known to law. It does not matter if the conviction is under the wrong section of the law.”Justice Muslim said Mrs Ogbuja understood the charge and pleaded not guilty to it as she “tailored her defence towards same.”He held that the appellant’s conviction did not occasion a miscarriage of justice, saying, “the offence is the defendant’s omission to take action against the sexual exploitation of Ochanya by her husband and her son.”"
